  rdfs:comment "This is the action that consumes the communication of a MakeAvailable, i.e. an OnDemandEvent. Consequently, it is an interactive action from the point of view of the consumer, who is able to determine the time line of the content. Usually, the content is consumed from its beginning and from the time point when the content is accessed. Moreover, the user is usually free to pause, resume, forward and rewind the content. However, all these issues are specific to the technological means used to make the content available, e.g. internet video on-demand streamers. It is important to note that this same features can be enjoyed with non-interactive communications but a recording system at the consumers place is then required."@en ;

It is not necessary that the medium be such that a human can perceive the work, as long as the work can be perceived by a machine. Thus, the song is also fixed the moment the author records it onto a cassette tape.
From the legal point of view, the fixations that are governed are those that store performances or communications of works that are later exploited. For instance, it can be a recording of a studio performance, which is governed by copyright because this fixation is intended for commercial exploitation.The more important kinds of fixations are sound recordings and motion pictures."""@en ;
